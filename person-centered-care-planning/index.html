The care manager's  role is essential in making this model a reality.\nAt the center of the diagram is The Person, the member—not the patient, not the diagnosis, but the individual with unique needs, values, and goals. Surrounding them are the key partners in care: nurses, doctors, pharmacists, personal care aides, family members, and the broader community. These are the people care coordinators help coordinate and align to ensure care is truly centered on the individual.\nThe outer ring highlights the principles that guide a care coordinators's work:\nFull Transparency: Keep individuals informed and involved in their care.\nShared Goal Setting: Collaborate with the person and their support network to define what success looks like.\nMission and Values Aligned with Patient Goals: Ensure that care plans reflect what matters most to the person.\nUnderstanding Individual Preferences: Go beyond clinical needs—learn about cultural, social, and emotional factors.\nHealth Equity: Identify and address barriers to care, especially for underserved populations.\nCollaborated and Coordinated Care: Facilitate communication across providers and services to avoid fragmentation.\nNotice a specific callout: ‘Family Viewpoints Respected and Valued.’ This is a reminder that families are not just visitors—they’re partners in care.\nAs care managers, you are the bridge between systems and members. A care manager's ability to listen, advocate, and coordinate is what transforms this model from a diagram into a lived experience for the individuals we serve.

a SMART goal example for Mary, a fictional member who wants to walk outside again like she used to. Her pain has been a barrier, so the care plan focuses on reducing her pain level and gradually increasing her stamina.\nThe goal is specific and measurable—Mary wants to reduce her pain from a 6–7 to a 3–4. It’s attainable through a combination of medication, physical activity with support, and pacing strategies.\nThis goal is relevant to Mary’s personal values—being outdoors helps her feel independent and emotionally well. The timeline is realistic, with progress reviewed every 60 days over a 6-month period.\nImportantly, this goal is supported by a team: her PCP manages her treatment, her aide helps with walking, and her care coordinator ensures the plan stays on track. Family members are also encouraged to support and celebrate her progress.\nThis example shows how a SMART goal can be both clinically sound and deeply personal—centered on what matters most to the member.\n\nThis next SMART goal focuses on improving social connection, which is a key part of emotional well-being. The member has shared that they often feel isolated and would like to talk to someone outside their home at least once a week.\nThe goal is specific and measurable—one meaningful interaction per week. It’s attainable through a mix of phone calls, community events, and support from the care team.\nIt’s also highly relevant to the member’s emotional health and sense of belonging. The goal will be reviewed in 60 days to see how it’s going and whether any adjustments are needed.\nThis example shows how person-centered care planning can support not just physical health, but also emotional and social needs—by involving the member’s support network and building on what matters most to them.\n\nA final SMART goal example focuses on nutrition and self-management.
