Here a care manager identifies the functional limitations or medical condition requiring D M E and that the equipment is medically necessary.\nFor MyCare plans this definition must meet both the Medicare and Medicaid definitions. Medicare's definition is that the equipment has a primarily medical purpose, is durable and is used in the home. Medicaid's definition follows Ohio Authorized Code 51 60 1 01 where one must establish a medical need for the D M E.\n\nThe second step is to obtain a prescription for the D M E for the member by ensuring that the member has been prescribed the D M E by someone with prescription authority. Those with prescription authority for D M E include Physicians, Podiatrists, Advanced Practice Registered Nurses with a relevant specialty, or physician assistants. The prescription must include a diagnosis, functional need, and the specific item being requested.\nPrescriptions are required by MyCare, Medicare, and Medicaid. For MyCare, the prescription must be accepted by the MyCare plan. For Medicare the prescription must come from a Meicare enrolled provider. Likewise for Medicaid a prescription must come from a Medicaid eligible provider. \n\nThe third step is to Gather documentation including face to face visit notes, written justification for the specific equipment, and any prior authorizations. You may need to conduct a face to face visit to facilitate this step. For MyCare a face to face visit is required for D M E typically within 6 months before the order for the D M E is placed where this matches the timing of a face to face visit needed for Medicare. For Medicaid a face to face visit is also needed before ordering D M E but the timing of this visit may vary depending on the equipment needed.\n\nThe fourth step is to determine the member's coverage either MyCare, Medicare, or Medicaid. Care managers then need to confirm if the item is covered under the MyCare Ohio Waiver Ohio Authorized Code 51 69 44 31, Medicare Part B, or the Ohio Medicaid State Plan Ohio Authorized Code 51 60 10\nIn this same step Care Managers may have to secure prior authorization where a member's healthcare provider seeks approval for D M E with that member's insurance plan. For MyCare prior authorizations are sometimes needed depending on the plan policy. Likewise, for Medicare prior authorizations are sometimes required where it depends on the D M E item, For Medicaid prior authorizations are often required for many D M E items.\n\nThe fifth step is to Identify a participating provider and process billing. D M E providers are those who sell and provide D M E equipment. Care managers will need to find a provide who will accept the member's plan and the reimbursement rate for the equipment provided by that plan. If a provider declines, then Care managers should continue searching for a D M E provider who will participate. \nFor MyCare, the Medicare portion of their MyCare plan pays first as the primary source where Medicaid then may cover remaining costs. For Medicare, medicare is the primary payer. For Medicaid, Medicaid is the primary payer.\n\nThe sixth step is to submit prior authorization, if required.\nCare managers must determine who the primary payer is—this depends on the member’s coverage:\nIf the member has Medicare only, Medicare is the primary payer.\nIf the member has Medicaid only, Medicaid is the primary payer.\nIf the member is dual eligible, Medicare is typically the primary payer, and Medicaid may cover remaining costs.\nIf the member is enrolled in a MyCare plan, the plan coordinates both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. In this case, the care manager must follow the MyCare plan’s specific process to determine which portion—Medicare or Medicaid—is responsible for the item.\n\nOnce prior authorization is approved, the next step is to coordinate delivery of the equipment.\nFor MyCare members, it’s important to determine which part of their plan is paying for the equipment:\nIf Medicaid is the primary payer, the Durable Medical Equipment provider must be enrolled with Ohio Medicaid and in-network with the member’s MyCare plan.\nIf the member has a separate Medicare Advantage plan outside of MyCare, the provider must be enrolled with Medicare and follow that plan’s network requirements.\nFor Medicare-only members, the provider must be a Medicare-enrolled Durable Medical Equipment supplier.\nFor Medicaid-only members, the provider must be a Medicaid-enrolled Durable Medical Equipment supplier.\nOnce a participating provider is identified, the eighth and final step is to follow up. Educate the member on how to use an maintain the equipment, confirm they received it, and monitor for any ongoing needs, repairs, or replacements.","voiceCode":"en-US-NancyNeural","language":"en","originalResourceId":"i7LhyCyfEz5vckpuc","ssml":"<speak \n            xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis\"\n            xmlns:mstts=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts\"\n            xmlns:emo=\"http://www.w3.org/2009/10/emotionml\" \n            version=\"1.0\" \n            xml:lang=\"en\"\n          >\n            <voice name=\"en-US-NancyNeural\">There are eight steps involved for a Care Manager to obtain D M E for a member where each step in the eight step process varies slightly depending on the payer, either MyCare, Medicare, or Medicaid.<break time=\"0.5s\"/><break time=\"0.5s\"/><break time=\"0.5s\"/>The first step is to assess the Member's needs.

Prior authorization may be required for custom or more expensive braces.\nFor individuals who are dual eligible meaning they qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid Medicare pays first, and Medicaid may cover the remaining costs, such as the 20% coinsurance or additional services not fully covered by Medicare.\nAs care managers, your role is to ensure that the prescription and documentation are complete and submitted through the appropriate channels to avoid delays in care.\n","voiceCodeUsed":"en-US-NancyNeural","featureAdoption":{"isUsingMultipleVoices":false,"isAddingPauses":false,"isAdjustingSpeed":false},"jobId":"wJ9aSDR7sDTJqogFt"}},"5LX3jih7Xgqgdgpgt":{"_id":"5LX3jih7Xgqgdgpgt","_siteID":"ZoiyEJNGnnXpx9Jbx","data":{"attributes":{"template":"resourceSlide","locale":"en","title":"Thank

This helps avoid delays and ensures members receive the supplies they need.","voiceCodeUsed":"en-US-NancyNeural","featureAdoption":{"isUsingMultipleVoices":false,"isAddingPauses":false,"isAdjustingSpeed":false},"jobId":"vFcoCxzGWmSiu6jGx"}},"BcMDyJSiQnktJHYRT":{"_id":"BcMDyJSiQnktJHYRT","_siteID":"ZoiyEJNGnnXpx9Jbx","data":{"attributes":{"template":"resourceSlide","locale":"en","title":"Knowledge Check 3"},"dates":{"dateCreated":"2025-05-29T14:47:12.033Z","dateModified":"2025-05-29T20:02:38.140Z"},"users":{"_userCreatorID":"fMCCj2F5RvKPEqE8F","_userModifierID":"fMCCj2F5RvKPEqE8F"},"assessment":{"graded":false,"showFeedback":true,"questions":["TAcaiXXTBLWLWXjTC"]},"video":{"autoPlay":true,"overlays":[{"identifier":"yNYcNi7nKPzWmAMSZ","kind":"overlay","type":"questionMatchText","width":1152,"height":725,"x":56,"y":-9,"entranceAnimation":{"type":"fadeIn","duration":500},"exitAnimation":{"type":"fadeOut","duration":500},"customStyle":{"verticalAlignment":"middle","type":"rectangle","lineHeight":1.2,"textAlignment":"center","border":{"color":"koantic(dark1, 0, 1)","size":0,"left":true,"top":true,"bottom":true,"right":true},"roundedCorners":{"topLeft":5,"topRight":5,"bottomLeft":5,"bottomRight":5},"fill":{"type":"color","color":"koantic(light1, 0, 1)"},"fontColor":"koantic(dark1, 0, 1)","padding":{"left":0,"top":0,"bottom":0,"right":0},"font":{"bold":false,"italic":false,"underline":false,"size":16},"shadow":{"angle":270,"distance":0,"blur":12,"color":"rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.53)"}},"questionId":"TAcaiXXTBLWLWXjTC","start":0,"behaviorType":"pause","rotationAngle":0}]}},"workspaceId":"oPYJFRcZXq3TGjd6g","assets":[],"childResources":[],"overlayTemplateIds":[],"fontFamilies":[]},"Bi7vgkNbAoQBrntvC":{"_id":"Bi7vgkNbAoQBrntvC","_siteID":"ZoiyEJNGnnXpx9Jbx","data":{"attributes":{"template":"resourceSlide","locale":"en","title":"Chart","upload":"nPfdxBrQPaNkAuSm2"},"dates":{"dateCreated":"2025-07-01T15:10:46.550Z","dateModified":"2025-07-01T17:24:32.317Z"},"users":{"_userCreatorID":"fMCCj2F5RvKPEqE8F","_userModifierID":"fMCCj2F5RvKPEqE8F"},"assessment":{"graded":false,"showFeedback":true},"video":{"autoPlay":true,"overlays":[{"identifier":"pJDhspPwGkez9RLru","kind":"overlay","type":"rectangle","width":1238.0000000000002,"height":637,"x":20.999999999999886,"y":41.5,"entranceAnimation":{"type":"fadeIn","duration":500},"exitAnimation":{"type":"fadeOut","duration":500},"customStyle":{"verticalAlignment":"middle","type":"rectangle","lineHeight":1.2,"textAlignment":"left","border":{"color":"koantic(dark1, 0, 1)","size":0,"left":true,"top":true,"bottom":true,"right":true},"roundedCorners":{"topLeft":0,"topRight":0,"bottomLeft":0,"bottomRight":0},"fill":{"type":"color","color":"koantic(light1, 0, 0)"},"fontColor":"koantic(dark1, 0, 1)","padding":{"left":0,"top":0,"bottom":0,"right":0},"font":{"bold":false,"italic":false,"underline":false,"size":20}},"start":0,"behaviorType":"continue","htmlContent":"<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width:100%\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"background-color:#145f82; border-bottom:none; border-left:none; border-right:none; border-top:none; height:48px; text-align:center; vertical-align:bottom; white-space:normal; width:161px\"><span style=\"font-size:19px\"><span style=\"color:white\"><strong>Step</strong></span></span></td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"background-color:#145f82; border-bottom:none; border-left:none; border-right:none; border-top:none; text-align:center; vertical-align:bottom; white-space:normal; width:161px\"><span style=\"font-size:19px\"><span style=\"color:white\"><strong>Medicare</strong></span></span></td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"background-color:#145f82; border-bottom:none; border-left:none; border-right:none; border-top:none; text-align:center; vertical-align:bottom; white-space:normal; width:161px\"><span style=\"font-size:19px\"><span style=\"color:white\"><strong>Medicaid (Ohio)</strong></span></span></td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"background-color:#145f82; border-bottom:none; border-left:none; border-right:none; border-top:none; text-align:center; vertical-align:bottom; white-space:normal; width:161px\"><span style=\"font-size:19px\"><span style=\"color:white\"><strong>Dual Eligible (MyCare)</strong></span></span></td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"background-color:#c0e4f5; border-bottom:none; border-left:none; border-right:none; border-top:none; height:77px; vertical-align:bottom; white-space:normal; width:161px\"><span style=\"font-size:19px\"><span style=\"color:black\">1.

Always ensure that documentation includes the diagnosis, functional limitations, and a prescriber’s order to support the request.","voiceCodeUsed":"en-US-NancyNeural","featureAdoption":{"isUsingMultipleVoices":false,"isAddingPauses":false,"isAdjustingSpeed":false},"jobId":"c58uRPjRBTaCBzodc"}},"dBwqqeawEbL7GTAL5":{"_id":"dBwqqeawEbL7GTAL5","_siteID":"ZoiyEJNGnnXpx9Jbx","data":{"attributes":{"locale":"en","template":"resourceSlide","title":"Slide 15","upload":"pNMPtRCqdGPbowapP"},"dates":{"dateCreated":"2025-05-20T16:34:30.826Z","dateModified":"2025-07-01T14:49:40.195Z"},"users":{"_userCreatorID":"fMCCj2F5RvKPEqE8F","_userModifierID":"fMCCj2F5RvKPEqE8F"},"video":{"autoPlay":true,"overlays":[{"identifier":"4tqsnruvSh28h4R7q","kind":"overlay","type":"rectangle","width":1224,"height":751.8857142857142,"x":0,"y":0,"entranceAnimation":{"type":"fadeIn","duration":500},"exitAnimation":{"type":"fadeOut","duration":500},"customStyle":{"verticalAlignment":"middle","type":"rectangle","lineHeight":1.2,"textAlignment":"center","border":{"color":"koantic(dark1, 0, 1)","size":0,"left":true,"top":true,"bottom":true,"right":true},"roundedCorners":{"topLeft":0,"topRight":0,"bottomLeft":0,"bottomRight":0},"fill":{"type":"color","color":"koantic(light1, 0, 0)"},"fontColor":"koantic(dark1, 0, 1)","padding":{"left":0,"top":0,"bottom":0,"right":0},"font":{"bold":false,"italic":false,"underline":false,"size":20}},"isImage":true,"imageAsset":"Ds2fYPr5BwkPCwbDr","isRatioFixed":true,"start":0,"behaviorType":"continue","rotationAngle":0},{"identifier":"s782QWDf3usaXFi6R","kind":"overlay","type":"rectangle","width":737,"height":45,"x":493,"y":186,"entranceAnimation":{"type":"fadeIn","duration":500},"exitAnimation":{"type":"fadeOut","duration":500},"start":0,"behaviorType":"continue","rotationAngle":0,"customStyle":{"border":{"size":0,"color":"koantic(accent1, 5, 1)","left":true,"top":true,"bottom":true,"right":true},"fill":{"color":"koantic(light2, 0, 1)","type":"color","opacity":0},"verticalAlignment":"middle","type":"rectangle","lineHeight":1.2,"textAlignment":"center","roundedCorners":{"topLeft":0,"topRight":0,"bottomLeft":0,"bottomRight":0},"fontColor":"koantic(light1, 0, 1)","padding":{"left":0,"top":0,"bottom":0,"right":0},"font":{"bold":false,"italic":false,"underline":false,"size":20},"title":"Untitled"},"clickAction":{"type":"openWebsite","openWebsite":"https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-administrative-code/rule-5160-10-21"}}],"background":{"backgroundColor":"rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)","backgroundImageOpacity":100},"duration":41.375,"captions":[{"text":"Ohio authorized code 5160 1021 is shown here","startTime":0.009,"finishTime":3.559},{"text":"to outline of coverage for incontinence supplies.","startTime":3.559,"finishTime":6.15},{"text":"These supplies are a Medicaid only benefit.","startTime":7.11,"finishTime":9.3},{"text":"Medicare does not cover them.","startTime":9.47,"finishTime":10.909},{"text":"The type and quantity of supplies approved are based","startTime":12.27,"finishTime":14.699},{"text":"on the underlying medical condition causing the incontinence.","startTime":14.699,"finishTime":18.209},{"text":"For example,","startTime":18.86,"finishTime":19.61},{"text":"someone with a neurological condition may require more","startTime":19.86,"finishTime":22.62},{"text":"frequent changes than someone with stress incontinence.","startTime":22.62,"finishTime":25.409},{"text":"To ensure coverage,","startTime":26.809,"finishTime":27.879},{"text":"documentation must include a clear diagnosis,","startTime":28.09,"finishTime":30.78},{"text":"a statement of medical necessity,","startTime":30.93,"finishTime":32.75},{"text":"and a prescription from a qualified provider.","startTime":32.889,"finishTime":35.24},{"text":"This helps Medicaid determine the appropriate","startTime":36.029,"finishTime":38.459},{"text":"level of support for each individual.","startTime":38.459,"finishTime":40.61}]}},"assets":["pNMPtRCqdGPbowapP","Ds2fYPr5BwkPCwbDr"],"childResources":[],"overlayTemplateIds":[],"fontFamilies":[],"voiceOver":{"voiceEditorContent":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Ohio Authorized Code 51 60 10 21 is shown here to outline of coverage for incontinence supplies.

Medicaid's definition follows Ohio Authorized Code 51 60 1 01 where one must establish a medical need for the D M E.\n\nThe second step is to obtain a prescription for the D M E for the member by ensuring that the member has been prescribed the D M E by someone with prescription authority. Those with prescription authority for D M E include Physicians, Podiatrists, Advanced Practice Registered Nurses with a relevant specialty, or physician assistants. The prescription must include a diagnosis, functional need, and the specific item being requested.\nPrescriptions are required by MyCare, Medicare, and Medicaid. For MyCare, the prescription must be accepted by the MyCare plan. For Medicare the prescription must come from a Meicare enrolled provider. Likewise for Medicaid a prescription must come from a Medicaid eligible provider. \n\nThe third step is to Gather documentation including face to face visit notes, written justification for the specific equipment, and any prior authorizations. You may need to conduct a face to face visit to facilitate this step. For MyCare a face to face visit is required for D M E typically within 6 months before the order for the D M E is placed where this matches the timing of a face to face visit needed for Medicare. For Medicaid a face to face visit is also needed before ordering D M E but the timing of this visit may vary depending on the equipment needed.\n\nThe fourth step is to determine the member's coverage either MyCare, Medicare, or Medicaid. Care managers then need to confirm if the item is covered under the MyCare Ohio Waiver Ohio Authorized Code 51 69 44 31, Medicare Part B, or the Ohio Medicaid State Plan Ohio Authorized Code 51 60 10\nIn this same step Care Managers may have to secure prior authorization where a member's healthcare provider seeks approval for D M E with that member's insurance plan. For MyCare prior authorizations are sometimes needed depending on the plan policy. Likewise, for Medicare prior authorizations are sometimes required where it depends on the D M E item, For Medicaid prior authorizations are often required for many D M E items.\n\nThe fifth step is to Identify a participating provider and process billing. D M E providers are those who sell and provide D M E equipment. Care managers will need to find a provide who will accept the member's plan and the reimbursement rate for the equipment provided by that plan. If a provider declines, then Care managers should continue searching for a D M E provider who will participate. \nFor MyCare, the Medicare portion of their MyCare plan pays first as the primary source where Medicaid then may cover remaining costs. For Medicare, medicare is the primary payer. For Medicaid, Medicaid is the primary payer.\n\nThe sixth step is to submit prior authorization, if required.\nCare managers must determine who the primary payer is—this depends on the member’s coverage:\nIf the member has Medicare only, Medicare is the primary payer.\nIf the member has Medicaid only, Medicaid is the primary payer.\nIf the member is dual eligible, Medicare is typically the primary payer, and Medicaid may cover remaining costs.\nIf the member is enrolled in a MyCare plan, the plan coordinates both Medicare and Medicaid benefits. In this case, the care manager must follow the MyCare plan’s specific process to determine which portion—Medicare or Medicaid—is responsible for the item.\n\nOnce prior authorization is approved, the next step is to coordinate delivery of the equipment.\nFor MyCare members, it’s important to determine which part of their plan is paying for the equipment:\nIf Medicaid is the primary payer, the Durable Medical Equipment provider must be enrolled with Ohio Medicaid and in-network with the member’s MyCare plan.\nIf the member has a separate Medicare Advantage plan outside of MyCare, the provider must be enrolled with Medicare and follow that plan’s network requirements.\nFor Medicare-only members, the provider must be a Medicare-enrolled Durable Medical Equipment supplier.\nFor Medicaid-only members, the provider must be a Medicaid-enrolled Durable Medical Equipment supplier.\nOnce a participating provider is identified, the eighth and final step is to follow up. Educate the member on how to use an maintain the equipment, confirm they received it, and monitor for any ongoing needs, repairs, or replacements.","jobId":"LCdrG2q4goZm45J5E","featureAdoption":{"isAddingPauses":true,"isUsingMultipleVoices":false,"isAdjustingSpeed":false},"voiceCodeUsed":"en-US-NancyNeural"}},"izbJWQeezAkqBphb7":{"_id":"izbJWQeezAkqBphb7","_siteID":"ZoiyEJNGnnXpx9Jbx","data":{"attributes":{"template":"resourceSlide","locale":"en","title":"Durable
